# parsingbot
This TelegramBot can parse degree data from TUM,Stanford and Oxford sites
Hello, this is my bot for degree programs in Oxford, Harvard and TUM
If you dont have any sites in dir "sites/", you need to start downloader.py first
parser.py is sorting all the data from dir "sites/" for Harvard, Oxford and TUM.
Then bot.py could be started if you have "degrees.json" file.
Its all, thanks for your time.
